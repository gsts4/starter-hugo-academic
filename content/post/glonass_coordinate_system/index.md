In fulfillment of the Russian Government Resolution No 1463 of December 28, 2012 “On the Common National Geodetic Coordinate Systems” starting from 3:00 pm on December 31, 2013 the transition to using the terrestrial geocentric coordinate system “Parametry Zemli 1990” (PZ-90.11) in operating the GLObal  NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS) has been implemented. 

The update to the reference system from PZ-90.02 apparently consists of an origin shift, small rotations of the axes, and a small scale change, all made in an effort to improve the alignment with respect to ITRF. The fundamental geodetic constants as well as the Earth’s ellipsoid parameters used in PZ-90.11 are provided in the Annex to the above mentioned Resolution. 

The updated version of the GLONASS ICD (edition 5.1 of 2008) is published at www.spacecorp.ru/directions/glonass/control_document
