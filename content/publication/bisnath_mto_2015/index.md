abstract: "Network RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) has become a standard method of precise, e.g., few centimetre- level, satellite-based positioning for urban land surveying applications. As such, MTO has been exploring this technology’s use for various types of MTO highway surveys. This report proposes approaches for the government certification of such network RTK services for use by MTO and potentially the broader community. Eleven recommendations have been made regarding: the integration of service providers’ reference stations into the provincial network; monitoring of service providers’ existing and new reference stations; and network RTK certification options for Ontario."
