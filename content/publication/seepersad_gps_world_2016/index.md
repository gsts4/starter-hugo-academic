abstract: "Ambiguity resolution in precise point positioning (hereafter, PPP-AR) requires that hardware delays within the GPS measurements be mitigated, which will then allow for resolution of the integer ambiguities within the carrier-phase measurements. Resolution of these ambiguities converts the carrier-phases into precise “range” measurements, with measurement noise at the centimeter-to-millimeter level compared to the meter-to-decimeter level of the C/A- and P(Y)-code pseudoranges. If the ambiguities could be isolated and estimated as integers, then that information could be exploited to accelerate PPP convergence to provide, for example, few-centimeter horizontal positioning accuracy within tens of minutes or even minutes from a cold start.

Integer ambiguity resolution of measurements from a single receiver can be implemented by applying additional satellite products, where the fractional component — representing the satellite hardware delay — has been separated from the integer ambiguities in a network solution. One method of deriving such products is to estimate the satellite hardware delay by averaging the fractional parts of steady-state real-valued or floating-point (float) ambiguity estimates, and the other is to estimate the receiver clock offset in the pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements independently by fixing the undifferenced ambiguities to integers in advance."
