abstract: "Over the past decade, network RTK technology has become popular as an efficient method of precise, real-time positioning.  Its relatively low-cost and single receiver ease-of-use has allowed it to mostly replace static relative GPS and single baseline RTK for, e.g., cadastral and construction surveys, in urban areas where such networks are economically viable.  The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) and York University have investigated the performance of commercial network RTK services in Southern Ontario, where performance is defined by a set of developed metrics.  It was found that the user horizontal solution had an overall precision of ~2.5 cm (95%), though there were cases of solution biases, drifts and gaps.  A follow-on study is developing criteria and pathways for the certification of such commercial network RTK services, focusing on: reference station integration, reference station maintenance, and user solution monitoring.  A set of recommendations for network certification is in preparation."
