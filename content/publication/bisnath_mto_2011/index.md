abstract: "The requirement to use newer methods of precise positioning is an ever growing need. Network Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS (GNSS) in particular, can provide centimetre-level positioning accuracy in real-time using only one user receiver and access to a wireless network, which is a significant improvement over traditional R TK and other static relative positioning methods. Network RTK has caught the interest of the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (M TO) as a replacement of static relative positioning methods for certain classes of control surveying. This report is essentially a feasibility study of network RTK performance in the context of M TO 
specifications."
